### The Hack
#### {{ page.friendly_eventdate }}
We need developers, experience designers, visual designers, quality analysts, business analysts, puzzle solvers, ideas people, managers, and anyone else with an interest in collaborative development, or the causes of privacy, digital rights, transparency, or accountability.

We'll form teams â€“ you don't need to be an expert in any field.

Children are welcome if you can keep an eye on them youself but we can't commit to providing childcare this time.
