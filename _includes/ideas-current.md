<p><strong>Re-decentralise the commercial web: a zero-knowledge recommendation system</strong></p>

<p>The commercial web is built on business models that aggregate personal data for the benefit of advertisers. What would the web look like if consumers had control over the algorithms that process their data?</p>

<p>Develop a system that ingests a user's loyalty-card or banking data. Use it to feed a recommender system that interfaces with a comparison shopping API to present the user with personalised offers for products they are likely to need, according to preferences they set, without providing any personal data to any third party.</p>

<p>One of the classic trade-offs on the web is that users give up control of their data in exchange for the convenience and benefit they receive from personalised services. Imagine instead that a user could keep their data securely within a personal data store and use private computing containers to run AI systems that process their data, all fully within their control. The ideal system would enable users to receive the benefits of personalisation that works in their interests, without providing their personal data to third parties. The system should be sensitive to a user's revealed preferences (their history) as well as to their express intent. For example, a user may opt to prefer goods or services that are more environmentally friendly, rather than being presented with offers that maximise revenue for a centralised commercial platform. In the long term, personalised, de-centralised computing provides an opportunity to build a more open, diverse web that works in the interests of users.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<ul>
<li><span>As a privacy-conscious consumer, I want to be presented with relevant offers that I can trust, so that I can get the convenience of Amazon's recommendations without handing over my data or submitting to their relevance and ranking criteria.</span></li>

<li><span>As a consumer who buys clothing online, I want to be presented with relevant offers for sustainable, ethically produced goods, so that I can conveniently make more ethical choices.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data cooperatives and distributive data justice</strong></p>

<p>Data collection, extraction, aggregation, predictive profiling on the commercial web is rampant exploitation of individual personal data in the current era of surveillance capitalism. Large corporations that collect and monetise personal information, rather than data subjects, are the main benefactors of this approach.</p>

<p>Imagine and create a system for individual and collective data stores for collective benefit -- individuals and communities should be able to meaningfully benefit from sharing information about themselves in ways that they can understand and control. The challenge is to develop a system to empower individuals to have greater control and autonomy about what they decide to give away, what is done with it, associated benefits (monetary or otherwise). The value of data, and the governance of the system, should be shared by cooperative members.</p>

<p>The objective is to re-balance the asymmetric and extractive relationship between data subjects and large corporations to achieve distributive data justice with new business models underpinned by ethical commitments (such as social justice, ecological and social sustainability).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li><span>I am an energy consumer and I want to be able to pool and share information about my energy consumption while retaining control of the way it us used to get a better deal on my energy rates and invest the difference in solar initiatives.</span></li>

<li><span>I am an internet user who wants to gain control and benefit from my browsing data and make more ethically informed decisions about the ways it is used rather than advertising being targeted at me and people like me.</span></li>
