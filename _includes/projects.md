# Projects started at IFH: Defending Truth

Participants started some excellent projects and built _amazing_ things on a tight schedule, including:

## Infinite Monkeys
A team in Brisbane worked on combating fake news by analysing where it comes from. They built a tool that analyses news to figure out the genesis of a story by looking for copy-pasted or very similar wording. They created a visualisation that shows the connections between news stories on different online news publications. We think this project has a lot of potential: imagine a browser add-on that adds a trustworthiness rating to news reports in social media, with links to original sources. Their work so far is on GitHub: [bertrand-caron/infinite_monkeys](https://github.com/bertrand-caron/infinite_monkeys).

## FaceWhatever
A team in Melbourne worked to improve public awareness of what information Facebook is gathering about them and what can be inferred from it. They designed a tool that compares what you think Facebook knows about you with what they really know by analysing your downloaded Facebook profile data. The tool would run without internet access (to prove it's not sharing your data). Their work so far is on GitHub: [robotdana/facewhatever](https://github.com/robotdana/facewhatever).

## E-Health
A team in Melbourne began work on a campaign and supporting website to raise awareness and increase uptake of the opt-out period for e-health records. This team is now working with the Australian Privacy Foundationâ€™s Health Committee to further develop the campaign.

## And many more
