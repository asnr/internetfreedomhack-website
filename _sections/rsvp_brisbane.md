We need developers, experience designers, visual designers, quality analysts, business analysts, puzzle solvers, ideas people, managers, and anyone else with an interest in collaborative development, or the causes of privacy, digital rights, transparency, or accountability. We'll form teams â€“ you don't need to be an expert in any field.

The event will take place at ThoughtWorks' Brisbane office over Friday 20 to Sunday 22 April

All meals and drinks will be provided.
