Subject: **Fighting back against internet apathy, privacy nihilism and the Government**

Join Dr Monique Mann in conversation with Lauri Love about all the terrible things that governments around the world are doing for internet freedom and privacy, with a focus on the ridiculous #waronmaths in Australia and across the Five Eyes alliance more broadly. We will talk through the options of what we can realistically do about it as scholactivists and hacktivists, and drawing from Loveâ€™s recent success fighting extradition and 99 years in a US prison, how to fight back against internet apathy, privacy nihilism and the government.
