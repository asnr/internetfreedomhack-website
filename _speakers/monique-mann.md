**Ass Access but “not a backdoor”**


In 2018 the Australian Government moved to introduce the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018 (Cth). If passed, this will increase the obligations of both domestic and offshore providers (very broadly defined) to assist law enforcement and security agencies to access information. It also introduces new computer access warrants that enable law enforcement to covertly obtain evidence directly from a device at the endpoints when information is not encrypted and increases existing powers to access data through search and seizure warrants. 

Dr Monique Mann will discuss the proposed law and offer her reflections on key issues as they relate to privacy, information security, mutual legal assistance and transnational data flows, and oversight of the new powers.
