**Algorised justice, privacy and a panoptic future**

The recent and rapid increase in technology and its societal application has created the need to carefully balance technology against fundamental human rights. The writer argues that technological development is inevitable and this inevitability bolsters the importance of informed discussion about its application and impact upon future generations. In this presentation, the ‘right to privacy’ is measured and assessed against the deployment of algorithmic solutions by the Courts and governments internationally.
