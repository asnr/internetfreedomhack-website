**What if our trust assumptions are wrong?**

Much of the internet infrastructure, and our usage of it, is based on trust assumptions about a relatively small group of organisations and agencies. It is those trust anchors that have allowed people from different sides of the globe, who may never have met, to interact and trade on an unprecedented scale. As we continue to move critical services online we should take a moment to ask whether the trust assumptions that were acceptable for online trade, remain acceptable for sensitive data collection.

Additionally, as governments around the globe introduce ever more intrusive access and interception laws, including Australiaâ€™s Access and Assistance Bill, those same organisations will come under increased pressure to undermine, or outright break, those very assumptions. In this talk we will look at what some of those assumptions are, how they have come under pressure for commercial and reliability reasons, and the possible impact of the introduction of interception laws.
