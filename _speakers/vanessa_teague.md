**Australian election integrity now**

"Australians tend to think of election-day disasters as things that happen in other countries, but actually Australian elections rely on a great deal of software that may not be any better than that in the US.  Our traditions of open and transparent democratic processes haven't entirely survived the transition - most of the software that counts your votes or receives them over the Internet is unavailable to meaningful public scrutiny.  This leaves us with election results that aren't supported by evidence that they're the ones Australian voters chose.  

In this talk I'll survey some of our results demonstrating serious software bugs and security problems in Australian voting and vote-counting software.   Then I'll ask what we could do to take advantage of the benefits of computers while ensuring we get the right election outcome."
