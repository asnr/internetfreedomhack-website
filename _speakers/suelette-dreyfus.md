**Assistance and Access Bill**

The Government has been rushing a proposed new law, Australiaâ€™s Access and Assistance Bill, through Parliament. It will make our society less (not more) secure. Offensive and defensive technologies are the yin and  yang of cybersecurity. This Bill forces Australia to tackle the tough question: It's good to be able to hack the other guy, but is it worth exposing your own citizens to risk being able to do so?

I've recently come back from Canberra, with others from civil society and industry. We told it straight to the politicians on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security - this Bill needs to be changed. It remains to be seen whether they will listen or not.

Come learn more about the Bill - what's wrong with it, and what you can do.
