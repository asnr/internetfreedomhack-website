Subject: **Internet Freedom Launchpad**

Digital rights, personal privacy and internet censorship are ongoing difficulties faced by citizens, especially in China. Chinese authorities  operate the largest internet censorship regime in the world and pragmatic difficulties of residing inside the Great Fire Wall of China have been exacerbated by recent regulations banning domestic ISPs from providing VPN services. The Internet Freedom Launchpad project, built a free, anonymous, dynamic, disposal, cloud based VPN that renders the current spectrum of digital censorship mechanisms ineffective. This is pretty awesome because it enables encrypted internet access for personal use by people whoâ€™s rights are affected by censorship regimes. Early adopters from within China are reporting that the product is working well and this now opens up the potential for the product to adapted for other regions of the world such as Iran, Turkey and Cuba. Internet Freedom hackathons are a fantastic opportunity to meet people you might not ever meet in your ordinary networks and to collaborate and build stuff that actually has a real world impact.
