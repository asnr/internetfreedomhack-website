**Rage against the Ghost in the Machine** _– this talk will kick off the hack on Friday evening_

You may not worry about your data today, but what will happen to it when you decide to leave a service? What could (and should) happen to it after death: the ultimate log out? What does your online presence look like when you are no longer around to pull its strings?

Outside of ‘Black Mirror’ episodes and art installations, the question of personal data and digital legacies is rarely seriously considered, and it leads to uncomfortable gaffes as digital services grapple with what to do when users die. This talk is a space to take stock of how the software we write today could be used in fifty years, and what design decisions we should make to ensure we can respect the wishes of the dead - and to make informed choices far easier for the living.
