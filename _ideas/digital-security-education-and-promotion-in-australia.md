A plan for educating and promoting digital security and the use of privacy-enhancing tools to the Australian general community.

The more people practice good digital security, the more difficult it would be for adversaries to track people who are connected to the internet, and the more protected all internet users will be. Whoever works on this idea should develop educational materials (or at least compile a directory of existing materials) and plans to deliver workshops. Access to safe venues and physical resources should also be considered.
