A physical intrusion detection system for detecting physical access to a device or premises.

Such a system should detect anomalies before the device under protection is reached. There is already a software app called "Haven" that is made to detect physical intrusion. Whoever works on this idea should develop a workable solution that is robust for long-time operation and robust against attempts to defeat it. CAW and other legal instruments that give powers to physically access devices and premises (and do so covertly) should be considered.
