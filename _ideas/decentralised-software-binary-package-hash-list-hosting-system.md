A secure decentralised hosting system for software binary/package hash lists that allows users to verify the integrity of their software.

Such a system would allow users of software to obtain the hashes so that they can verify the integrity of the software they use. It may also allow hash list hosts to cross-check their lists against other hosts and identify inconsistencies. Although the hosting of hash lists are decentralised, the hosts must be trusted to a certain degree. How the hosts securely obtain the correct hashes of software must be considered carefully.
