An intrusion detection system for detecting unauthorised network access to a device.

There are already techniques and software for checking the integrity of devices such as taking snapshots (hashing all files on a system), as well as for analysing network traffic such as "Wireshark." Whoever works on this idea should develop a workable solution that is effective at detecting unauthorised network access and system tampering. CAW and other legal instruments that give powers to remotely hack devices and networks (and do so covertly) should be considered.
