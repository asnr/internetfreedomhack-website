## Lilly Ryan – Rage against the Ghost in the Machine

Lilly Ryan is a PENTESTER, SECURITY ENGINEER, and AFTERLIFE ARCHITECT.

You may not worry about your data today, but what will happen to it when you decide to leave a service? What could (and should) happen to it after death: the ultimate log out? What does your online presence look like when you are no longer around to pull its strings?

Outside of ‘Black Mirror’ episodes and art installations, the question of personal data and digital legacies is rarely seriously considered, and it leads to uncomfortable gaffes as digital services grapple with what to do when users die. This talk is a space to take stock of how the software we write today could be used in fifty years, and what design decisions we should make to ensure we can respect the wishes of the dead - and to make informed choices far easier for the living.

## Angus Murray –  Algorised justice, privacy and a panoptic future

Angus Murray is VICE PRESIDENT OF THE QUEENSLAND COUNCIL FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES.

The recent and rapid increase in technology and its societal application has created the need to carefully balance technology against fundamental human rights. The writer argues that technological development is inevitable and this inevitability bolsters the importance of informed discussion about its application and impact upon future generations. In this presentation, the ‘right to privacy’ is measured and assessed against the deployment of algorithmic solutions by the Courts and governments internationally.

## Glenn Harper – We need to talk about fake news
Glenn Harper is a LIBRARIAN INTERESTED IN FAKE NEWS AND DIGITAL MEDIA LITERACY.

We all think that we are immune from fake news. Even Flat Earthers believe they are the most skeptical and best informed peeple in the chat room. But how good are we at really sorting the accurate from the misleading and downright fake when we peruse our social media feed? Let’s put ourselves to the test and discover how good our digital media literacy really is.

## Julian Scharf – Rise of the machines: Ghosts in the queue
Julian Scharf is a SOFTWARE ENGINEER at FUNCAPTCHA.

What do airfares, rock concerts and retro gaming consoles have in common? They all have millions of bots waiting in line to place orders. Artificially inflated queues are a growing problem, and in nearly all cases, the consumer loses out. Julian, an engineer will be speaking about “ghost queues” where they occur and the economic fall out for both vendors and consumers.

Join Dr Monique Mann in conversation with Lauri Love about all the terrible things that governments around the world are doing for internet freedom and privacy, with a focus on the ridiculous #waronmaths in Australia and across the Five Eyes alliance more broadly. We will talk through the options of what we can realistically do about it as scholactivists and hacktivists, and drawing from Love’s recent success fighting extradition and 99 years in a US prison, how to fight back against internet apathy, privacy nihilism and the government.
