Internet freedom means a lot of things.

We want an internet that makes us more connected, more ourselves, and more equal. But the internet of today can make us more isolated, more afraid to be ourselves, and more like the property of tech giants such as Google and Facebook.

**For submitting ideas, we’re encouraging you to think big:**

- How can the internet be a force for good in our personal lives?
- How can the internet be a force for good in society?
- Can we use the internet in a different way to how we use it today?
- What existing projects can we build on or support?

For examples of the kinds of ideas you could work on, XXXXXX:

- THING 1
- THING 2
- THING 3
- THING 4

Ideas can be big and crazy or just for fun – they are starting points, and they don’t have to be technical. The event is about getting together with like-minded people, getting started and having fun, evolving our ideas as we go.

The best ideas for the weekend will be:

- **clear**
- **achievable**
- something that **improves** your life or the life of someone you know
- something you would **like** to work on over the weekend with a team of 4-6 people

Get ready to present your idea on the Friday night. If your idea doesn't get selected, don't worry; you can join forces with someone else – we'll make sure that you're part of a group.

Please send us a sentence or two describing your ideas using the form below and we'll put them up here. Get your thinking hats on and submit as many as you like!
